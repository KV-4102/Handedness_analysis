# Handedness_analysis
In this project, we will explore this phenomenon using age distribution data to see if we can reproduce a difference in average age at death purely from the changing rates of left-handedness over time, refuting the claim of early death for left-handers. This notebook uses pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of being a certain age at death given that you are reported as left-handed or right-handed.

**1)Locating the oldLeft-Handed Demographic**

A survey conducted by National Geographic in 1986 garnered an extensive dataset comprising over a million responses. This dataset encompassed information regarding respondents' age, gender, as well as their hand preferences for tasks such as throwing and writing. Upon thorough examination of this dataset, researchers Avery Gilbert and Charles Wysocki observed a noteworthy pattern: the prevalence of left-handedness was approximately 13% among individuals below the age of 40, but gradually declined with increasing age to approximately 5% among those aged 80 and above. Their analysis further revealed that this age-dependent trend was predominantly influenced by the evolving social acceptance of left-handedness.

This intriguing discovery implies that the rates of left-handedness are not solely a product of one's chronological age but are intrinsically linked to the era in which one was born. Consequently, if the same survey were conducted today, we could anticipate a modified manifestation of the same distribution, contingent upon the prevailing attitudes towards left-handedness. This raises a fascinating question concerning the potential impact of this shifting rate on the apparent average lifespan of left-handed individuals. However, before delving into the implications for life expectancy, it is prudent to commence our exploration by graphically depicting the variations in left-handedness rates across different age groups.

**Trends in Left-Handedness Rates Across Eras**

Our next step involves the transformation of this dataset into a comprehensive plot illustrating the prevalence of left-handedness in relation to the birth year. To ensure a unified representation, we will compute an average rate by amalgamating data from both male and female participants.

Given that the original study was conducted in 1986, the resulting data from this transformation will provide us with a crucial insight â€“ specifically, it will depict the proportion of individuals alive in 1986 who exhibit left-handedness tendencies, contingent upon their birth year.

The Application of Bayes' Theorem
It's crucial to recognize that the likelihood of passing away at a specific age, given that you are left-handed, is not equivalent to the probability of being left-handed given that you've reached a certain age. This disparity underscores the significance of Bayes' theorem, a fundamental concept in conditional probability, enabling us to revise our beliefs based on observed evidence.

Our objective is to compute the probability of one's demise at age A, denoted as P(A | LH), for left-handed individuals. Similarly, we seek the same probability for right-handers, denoted as P(A | RH).

Bayes' theorem can be applied to the two events we are concerned with: left-handedness (LH) and the occurrence of death at age A.

P(LH | A) represents the probability that an individual is left-handed, given that they passed away at age A. P(A) stands for the overall probability of death occurring at age A, and P(LH) is the overall likelihood of being left-handed. We will now proceed to calculate each of these three values, commencing with P(LH | A).

To determine P(LH | A) for ages falling beyond the original dataset, we must extrapolate the data to encompass earlier and later years. Given that the rates exhibit a plateau in the early 1900s and late 1900s, we will employ several data points at each extremity and calculate the average to estimate the rates for those time frames. While the choice of the number of points used for this estimation may be somewhat arbitrary, we will opt for 10 data points, considering that the data appears relatively stable until approximately 1910.
